AMP-1001
========

A second IRC bot made by me.

Overview:
   Although in some ways he will be similar to my previous IRC bot, AMP-1001 will also have some noticeable differences. The most important change will be the permissions/recognizing system, which is based on how high a user's permission rank is. Different commands will require different ranks, and all are stacked.

Commands:
(Commands are still being added, this won't be complete for a while)

+say (#chan-name) <text>: Say something into the channel. Add the channel to specify which. Required rank: 10
+quit: Quit the server. Required rank: 10
+join <#chan-name>: Join the specified channel. Required rank: 7
+leave (#chan-name): Leave the channel. Add the channel to specify which. Required rank: 7

More stuff will be added soon.
